# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I was thinking of doing an asteroid-type game with a spaceship shooting asteroids. To expand on the regular asteroid idea I might have different areas or on screen challenges or different kinds of asteroid (exploding, indestructable) or any combination of those ideas, depending on how quickly/well I pick up the necessary language.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I don't have a team.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

No questions at the moment.
